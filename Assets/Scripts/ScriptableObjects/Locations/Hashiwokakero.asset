  _instructions: 'Click on an island to select it.

    Click on a second island
    horizontally or vertically aligned to build a bridge.

    You can build up to
    two bridges between the same pair of islands. Attempting to build a third bridge
    will remove all bridges between the two islands.

    Bridges cannot intersect,
    and cannot be obstructed by an island.


    In order to win, each island should
    be connected with a number of bridges equal to its label.'
